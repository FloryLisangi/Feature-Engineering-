When we run models, we want the most simple model possible with the most predictive power.

We will talk about train/test split in more detail later, but be aware that this kind of processing will need to be carried out on train/test fitted data. In general, statisticians are not very fond of feature selection, they argue it is a form of p-hacking, and that we should only include and carry out the tests we planned in advance.\n",

In this case, we carry out a test on a single independent variable/feature (the uni in univariate) against our dependent variable/target. We can then choose among the features based on a threshold p-value or other test, or among a ranking. \n",
